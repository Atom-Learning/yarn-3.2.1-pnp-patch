As described in @yarnpkg/berry [Issue #1818](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/1818), using Yarn 3.2.1 with Node 18 can sometimes throw the following error:

```log
TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "path" argument must be of type string. Received an instance of Buffer

This repo patches `sources/hook.js` in @yarnpkg/pnp, which provides the template for the `.pnp.cjs` file where the issue arises, based on the [temporary fix provided by vicary](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/1818#issuecomment-1065829365).

Because yarn runs from a compiled release file in your local repository at `./.yarn/releases/yarn-*-.cjs`, the patch has to be compiled into the release. Do this in your local project by running

```bash
yarn set version from sources --repository https://github.com/troncali/yarn-3.2.1-pnp-patch
```
